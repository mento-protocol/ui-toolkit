### Patch Changes

- 3ff0bd3: Modernize publishing workflow with improved GitHub Actions permissions handling. This update adds NPM package provenance, better error handling, and more robust publishing checks. It also updates the changesets configuration to use modern options and explicitly sets package access to public. Documentation has been added to explain the publishing workflow in detail.
- 5e0fb70: Fix TypeScript compatibility issues with third-party dependencies by removing typechecking from CI and disabling the `@typescript-eslint/prefer-ts-expect-error` rule.
