# Set up Web3 Configuration Components and Hooks

## Description

Create standardized Web3 configuration components and hooks that will be shared across all applications. This includes setting up wagmi, Rainbow Kit, and common contract interaction patterns.

## Technical Requirements

- Set up wagmi configuration with:
  - Supported chains
  - RPC configurations
  - Common hooks patterns
- Configure Rainbow Kit with:
  - Custom theme support
  - Wallet connection flows
  - Modal customization
- Create reusable contract interaction hooks:
  - Read contract hooks
  - Write contract hooks
  - Event listener hooks
- Set up ABI management system

## Tasks

- [ ] Create base wagmi configuration
  - [ ] Define supported networks
  - [ ] Set up RPC endpoints configuration
  - [ ] Configure chain-specific settings
- [ ] Implement Rainbow Kit setup
  - [ ] Create theme configuration
  - [ ] Set up wallet connectors
  - [ ] Implement custom styling to match our brand
- [ ] Develop contract interaction hooks
  - [ ] Create base contract hook factory
  - [ ] Implement common read operations
  - [ ] Implement common write operations
  - [ ] Set up event listeners
- [ ] Create ABI management system
  - [ ] Set up ABI versioning
  - [ ] Create type generation pipeline
  - [ ] Document ABI usage patterns

## Acceptance Criteria

- All Web3 configurations are centralized and easily importable
- Rainbow Kit is properly themed and matches our brand guidelines
- Contract interaction hooks are type-safe and well-documented
- Configuration can be easily extended for different environments
- Integration examples are provided in the example app
- Unit tests cover core functionality
- Documentation includes usage examples

## Dependencies

- NextJS UI Component repo setup must be completed first
- Access to current Web3 configurations from existing repos
- List of supported networks and RPC endpoints

## Additional Notes

- Consider creating a configuration generator for different environments
- Document best practices for contract interaction patterns
- Include error handling patterns
- Consider gas optimization strategies in hook implementations
